# EnRoute 🪩
An ENS-powered programmable payments app.

## 🌍 Overview
EnRoute lets users automate recurring payments and fund distributions using ENS subnames.  
Example:
`alice.enrouteapp.eth` → `payroll.alice.enrouteapp.eth` → funds are then split automatically based on a policy created by the user:
- 20% → Finance  
- 20% → Management  
- 60% → Operations  

Perfect for payrolls, DAO treasury flows, bounty payouts, and automated subscriptions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Create an ENS subname (e.g. `alice.enrouteapp.eth`)
2. Set a payment policy defining how incoming funds are split
3. Send funds to your ENS — EnRoute handles the routing automatically
